This is the script for the exercise sessions of the bachelor course Molecular Modelling as taught at the Utrecht University.

# Scripts

* `EM_and_MD.py`: Intended to be send to the students
* `EM_and_MD_answers_wc2.py`: Gives the solution for the Steepest Descent method, can be send to the students after exercise session 2.
* `EM_and_MD_answers_wc3.py`: Gives the solution for both the Steepest Descent and Verlet methods, can be send to the students after exercise session 3.

# Intended use in the MolMod course

* Exercise session 2: Download the script and implement the Steepest Descent method at line 109.
* Exercise session 3: Check answers from last session and implement the Verlet method at line 152.
* Exercise session 4:
    * Check answers from last session.
    * Exercise 1: Toggle the boolean at line 58 from `True` to `False`.
